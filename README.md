## Installation

Install dependencies and add a `databaseConfiguration.json` file in the `database` folder to connect to your local postgres DB.

## Start

After installing your local postgres database, run `configure_db.sh` to drop any old DB and create a new one (named `postgres`).

## Description

My own node API for open source projects. Further content will be added to this project and the README along this year.
